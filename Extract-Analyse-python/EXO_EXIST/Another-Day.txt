Start again
Empty your mind of thoughts
Leave the past moments behind
Will you let go of the unnecessary worries?
Let it all flow

I was trapped in yesterday
I realize the moment I take a step
When I open my eyes again

Another day, as if it's the first time
The sun rises again, another day
It's totally different from yesterday, everything is new
Fill it up as much as you want, whatever you do, it will be good
Another day

Day, day, day (Ooh)
Day, day, day
Day, day, day (Oh, yeah)

All the regrets
It's proof that I've been running without rest
All of your moments are beautiful
The fact that does not change no matter what anyone says
You're incredible, uh

I don't know tomorrow, but oh
For some reason I'm looking forward to real life
Yeah, when I open my eyes again

Another day, as if it's the first time
The sun rises again, another day
It's different from yesterday, everything is new
Fill it up to your heart's content, you can do anything
Another day

Yeah, another day
This is a new chap
A different color every day
Both yesterday and tomorrow today
Looking back, there is a rainbow in the sky
There is excitement in your steps
Crescendo
Open the window
After all worries go with the wind
The sunlight hits the dark side of my heart, uh
Sunshine on me
I'm going to make another day today
I'm going to spread it out, it's no problem
I'm good (Ooh)

Another day (Another day)
Right now (No, no, woah)
Too good to stop
Hot days and dazzling nights (Another day)
Draw a new me at this moment (draw, oh)
Another day

Day, day, day (You)
Day, day, day (Oh, woah-woah)
Day, day, day (Yeah)
Another day (Oh)
Day, day, day (Another day)
Day, day, day (No, no)
Day, day, day (No, no, no, no, no, no)
Another day
