The pendulum between us has stopped
City view that has become more colorful beyond our eyes
A door that urges you like a lie
A dance that was cut off in an instant, oh-woah-woah

The clock is already twelve (Late)
Unbelievably
Before the rush of time (No way)
No one can stop you

In the waking darkness
Ooh, na-na-na you like this
I don't want to let you go, Cinderella

La-la-la-la-la-la, Cinderella
La-la-la-la, Cinderella
La-la-la-la-la-la, Cinderella
La-la-la-la, Cinderella

Ayy, turn everything upside down like a fairy tale, uh
My heart is already pounding
Ayy, it's just you ain't nobody else
Break all the rules that confined you
(Hold up)
You will disappear and I will stay here
I don't want a glass shoes
Please don't leave me like this (No)
Don't break our dream

In this familiar scene (Wait)
I lost you in the end
So that I won't regret all night (Just wait)
I have to change this ending

In the waking darkness
Ooh, na-na-na you like this
I don't want to let you go Cinderella

La-la-la-la-la-la, Cinderella
La-la-la-la, Cinderella
La-la-la-la-la-la, Cinderella
La-la-la-la, Cinderella

Can't you stay by my side
Until the sun rises tomorrow, baby
Stay like this forever
Cinderella
Woah, Cinderella

La-la-la-la-la-la, Cinderella
La-la-la-la, Cinderella
La-la-la-la-la-la, Cinderella
La-la-la-la, Cinderella
