Feel that tinglin', that silky smooth cream
Each swirl deepens the flavor, babe
Feeling parched and a little bit reckless
Won't settle for anything less
A delightful mouthful

Baby, come closer, a delightful mouthful
Never felt this kind of attraction before
This tension, like a bottle of cola shaken
You're a sparkling drink, pop, already opened
Can't think straight no more
In front of love, I'm tipsy, baby
Pretending to be picky, even if I measure it here and there
I just know this tastes too good to be healthy

Uncontrollable appetite
A taste that shook my everything
I need all ya cream soda
The more it melts, the sweeter it gets
Take my heart out
I need all ya cream soda

Feel that tinglin' (Cream)
That silky smooth cream (Soda)
Each swirl deepens the flavor, baby (Cream)

Baby go dum dum, shakin' my thinkin'
Just a sip, but already brain freezin'
Give me that yum, yum, tasty and teasin'
Got me wrapped around your little flavor
Yeah, sweet like a bon-bon dessert
With one sip, instantly dumb, dumb befooled
Pumped the brakes, but instincts are so fast
Can't stop here, you know I gon' get it, get it

Uncontrollable appetite (Get it, get it)
A taste that shook my everything
I need all ya cream soda
The more it melts, the sweeter it gets
Take my heart out
I need all ya cream soda

Foam overflowing, fill it up (Oh, fill it up)
Top it off gently, get it up (Oh, get it up)
Not one drop lost, drink it all
It's spreading love so sweet
Wanna dive to their depths
Your crystal-clear waters so cool it hurts
Keep me wanting
Thaw your heart just a bit
Can I get just a taste of it?

Appetite haunting my heart, got me hooked
I need all ya cream soda (Oh yeah, soda)
The slower the sip, the sweeter
How does it end, I wanna know
I need all ya cream soda

So baby, tonight whet my appetite cream soda
Feel that tinglin', that silky smooth cream
Each swirl deepens the flavor, baby
Feeling parched and a little bit reckless
Won't settle for anything less
