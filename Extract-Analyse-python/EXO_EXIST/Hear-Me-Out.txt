One, two, three

Look babe, I like you even more
I spread my wings and soar on your love, let's fly together
I know I mess up, baby, I can't help it
Trying to push me away, just save it for later
'Cause I've been thinking bout some time with you
All this is just the beginning for me
Want absolutely nothing in return, my baby
Gazing at the same skies all night long, my favorite thing
Girl, just

Don't think too hard
We are only wasting time, love

Hear me out, hear me out, hear me out
So what? It's all good
Hear me out, hear mе out, hear me out
No need to hesitatе
Oh, babe, hold me closely
Thinking too much messes with your flow
You know I don't play games

Never have you shown me
Lookin' so good, busy getting ready to leave
Treatin' me like this you're teachin' me
How to reach you, even clearer now
And I can't see you here frustrated
To put it bluntly, I need you, baby
You know me, why play with words?
Instead, I walk the talk, and you'll be mine for the night, yeah

You move back a step
Don't try so hard to slip away, my love
Just make one thing clear for me
Tell me straight and tell it all and then some more
Don't try to hide it

Hear me out, hear me out, hear me out (Come on, come on)
So what? It's all good
Hear me out, hear me out, hear me out (Come on)
No need to hesitate
Oh, babe, hold me closely (Hold me close, come on)

Thinking too much messes with your flow (Cautious much?)
You know I don't play games
Your heart's closed (Hesitating perhaps)
But hidden inside (No need to hide)
Is your truth (Already showing)
Tell me the truth (Be real)
I'll be the first to fully open my heart to you. Show me yours too

Hear me out, hear me out, hear me out (Hear me out, come on)
So what? It's all good
Hear me out, hear me out, hear me out
No need to hesitate (Hear me out, baby, come on)
Oh, babe, hold me closely (Yeah, yeah, hold me close)
Feels like we're the only ones in focus (Yeah, see only you)
Let's not waste any more time

Gonna be true to every moment
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
So as to not regret a single moment
Eh-oh
Wherever the heart leads
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
