Vanishing into the dark, you're gone
Wait, don't hide from me again
Struggling, but even if you sink, it's fine
Make your way to me through the waves

I am not much without you
Day or night no longer matters
Lay this hollow heart upon the waves
All this and more I crave

Want to drift off in your soft embrace
If possible, hold me and Let me in
'Cause it's blue, your eyes
Gotta let me in you're the ocean
Everyday I wait

Hey, if you will let me in your heart, deeper I'll go
Surf over the high waves
Engulf into a trap
I'm the one always getting carried away
See no evil, speak no evil, try as I may
You suck me in, there's no exit
Already down in the sunless depths
Unfathomably deep and lonely, but
You're the ocean current pullin' me down
Go ahead and devour me
Wherever you want me, I will go

Might as well just let go and flow
Give in to the feelings washin' over me
Speak honestly, from deep inside
Still uncertain of thoughts we have aplenty

Want to drift off in your soft embrace
If possible, hold me and Let me in
'Cause it's blue, your eyes
Gotta let me in you're the ocean
Everyday I wait

Even if everything stops, and I can't see or hear
Or breathe, I still make my way to you to you
Even if everything stops, put your lips on mine
Even if it won't last, let's stay this way, this way

Want to remain in your soft embrace
Hold me in the deepest depth, let me in
'Cause it's blue, your eyes (Yeah)
Everyday I wait (For you waiting) (Oh)

Sailing against the wind (For you waiting)
To the edge of our world (I want you, I want you; To you)

Fall into you, the bluest water (Yeah)
'Cause you're my ocean
