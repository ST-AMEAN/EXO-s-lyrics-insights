You sometimes you act affectionate
But it feels like an illusion, approaching you is like touching ice
An immeasurable temperature that I like, oh, why?
No, no, no, no

The gap between us is different every day
Even if sometimes it feels like a bad joke
I am always willing to lose to you
Oh, my, my, my, my

Even a few short words
Will be enough, I want to hear it
Get away, get away
You can't get away
Come to me
I will tell you my answer

I feel like a fool
I am lost every day
Watchu, watchu want
Watchu, watchu want
I'm filled only with you
My heart is full
What's going on
Give me that truth
Gimme, gimme that
Gimme that
Gimme that truth
You make me a fool
I like that

Let's go deep into you
I'm so into it
Let's go a little deeper
I'm so into it

Yo, ayy, everyone says they fell deeply
Whatever they say, it's okay
I don't care, call me love fool
I like that description
How I appear in others' eyes, is it important?
I can't hide anything because it's all of you

Even if you overflow in my hands, it's not enough
I want to give you everything
The only thing I want to treasure is you
Oh, my, my, my, my

I'm trapped in the ocean that is you
I want to see only you all day
Get away, get away
You can't get away
Come to me
Can you give me your answer now?

I feel like a fool
Lost every day
Watchu, watchu want
Watchu, watchu want
I'm filled only with you
My heart is full
What's going on
Give me that truth
Gimme, gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that truth
You make me a fool
I like that

Any words are fine
Except for one, no, no, no
My answer is already decided
You can wait if you want
Take it slow, as much as you want
My next move is all up to you, ah, yeah

I feel like a fool
Curious about your everyday life
Watchu, watchu do
Watchu, watchu do
I keep falling deeply, love fool
I can't escape
What's going on?
Give me that truth
Gimme, gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that truth
You make me a fool
As if I don't care

Let's go deeper into you
Fall deeply
Let's go deeper
Fall deeply
Let's go, we're deeply connected
