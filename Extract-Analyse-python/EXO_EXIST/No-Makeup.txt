Ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh
No, oh
Oh-oh

Your slightly smudged lipstick
There is no need to reapply it
Allow me to do it myself
I want to erase everything (Oh)
A heart that's about to explode (Heart)
More than any other color
Your sensational green light
On a long and risky night
Cut the strings of reason

Yeah, it seems like its just a little bit tangled
Even your hair is beautiful
There's just somethin' I love about you

I love you with no makeup on
Even the unadorned appearance is beautiful
Even if you don't care
Above your pretty eyes, nose and mouth
A little kiss like
La da-da-da, da-da-da
Open your heart little by little
Show me your honest self
So take the makeup off

Turn off all the dazzling lights
You will be enough for me, yeah (Yeah)
Your mood right now drives me crazy (Only drives me crazy)
As the night deepens (Yeah, yeah)
Let's just love simply (Let's love)
Babe, before this breath vanishes into thin air

Yeah, at the moment our eyes collide
Even time seems to have stopped
And that's somethin' I love about you

I love you with no makeup on (Yeah)
Even the unadorned appearance is beautiful (Yeah)
Even if you don't care
Above your pretty eyes, nose and mouth
A little kiss like (a little kiss like)
La-da-da-da, da-da-da (La, da-da-da)
Open your heart little by little
Show me the honest you (Show you)
So take the makeup off

Slow down, baby, please
Take it all off if you want
Our feelings for each other became even more certain, oh-woah-woah (Each other's feelings)
The more honest
The reason why my heart flutters (You you, you)
The answer is you, oh

I love you with no makeup on (Ooh)
Even the unadorned appearance is beautiful (Yeah)
Even if you don't care (Oh)
Above your pretty eyes, nose and mouth
A little kiss like
La-da-da-da, da-da-da (Ooh)
Open your heart little by little
Show me the honest you (show me, no)
So take the makeup off

Yo, uh, in this moment, openly
Show me the real you
Baby, you don't need no makeup
Uh, we can be more relaxed and natural
Laugh together
Baby, you don't need no makeup (Ooh)
Please in front of me
I hope you can be the most like you, no-no (Oh-oh)
So take your makeup off
