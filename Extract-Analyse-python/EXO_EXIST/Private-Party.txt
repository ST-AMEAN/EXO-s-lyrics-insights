Mm-mm, yeah-yeah
Yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, yeah

At the end of your gaze
Heart explode
Crossing an out of control line
Reason is ice, everything is cold
With only dangerous instincts left
A very crowded party, deepening relationship
A body led by a heart that I slip into you
As if my feet secretly slipped, I am fallin' in to you
Eyes that keep meeting
It's not a coincidence, the two of us

In an atmosphere covered with darkness (inside)
Leave us alone (Leave)
Perfect timing comes closer (Yeah)
Even the sound of your breath, block (block)
Turn the music up
Do the same dance
The more honest you are, the better drop (Oh)
Even if you don't speak
We know what's up (Yeah, yeah)
There's no reason to be in a hurry

Continue like this
Just dance with me
Slowly, lips on me
Show your true colors
Deep breath
What can I say?
Leave the charade behind
Baby, you know what to do

That's my shawty, yeah
That's my shawty, babe
Let's get it started
Our own private party
That's my shawty, yeah
That's my shawty, babe
Touch my body
Our own private party, yeah

She likes to party, party (Party, party)
She likes to party, party (Party, party)
She likes to party, party
Our own private party (Uh)

Let me get to romancin' with you
Of the countless people in this space
We recognize each other, as if it's destiny (Oh-woah)
Guess the next thing
Two more pulling
Under the twinkling lights, you are great
Play the feelings you feel honestly (Ooh)
Don't try to break this tension
So that we can continue to double (Oh)

Stop time
Just chance on me
On this wonderful night
Because it suits you perfectly
Just like now
What can I say?
Let go of tension
Baby, you know what to do

That's my shawty, yeah (That's my shawty)
That's my shawty, babe (Oh-ooh)
Let's get it started
Our own private party
That's my shawty, yeah (That's my shawty)
That's my shawty, babe (That's my shawty)
Touch my body (Ooh-oh)
Our own private party, yeah

Our own private party, private party
She likes to party, party (Party, party)
She likes to party, party (Party, party)
She likes to party, party (Yeah)
Our own private party

Turn the lights down low (Oh)
In this intimate moment (In this moment)
Baby, girl, the bolder the better (good)
It's whatever you want (Oh)

That's my shawty, yeah
That's my shawty, babe (Yeah)
Let's get it started
Our private p-p-p-p-p-party
That's my shawty, yeah (Private party)
That's my shawty, babe
Touch my body (Yeah)
Our own private party
