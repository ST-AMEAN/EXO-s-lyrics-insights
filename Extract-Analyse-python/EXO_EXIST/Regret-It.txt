I'm on your side
I'm on your side
I-I'm on your side
Let's bring it, baby

(Warn, warn, warn 'em 'bout that sign)
(Warn, warn, warn 'em 'bout that sign)
(Warn, warn, warn 'em 'bout that sign)
(Warn, warn, warn 'em 'bout that sign)
(Warn, warn) Woo, you started everything
(Warn, warn) Woo, I'm ready to risk everything
(Warn, warn) Dive in, heh (Incoming)

Tell me, my heart races when I see you
Where will you take me?
Will you stay anywhere forever?
All of my days dive into you
I don't want to escape, no way out
Just one take down of intensity

So, baby, let me know what you feel right now
All I want is you

So don't make me regret it
I wish every day was endless
My feelings for you
Don't let them get lost
Don't make me regret it
Woo, you started everything (Ooh-woah)
Woo, I'm ready to risk everything
Don't make me regret it
Woo, if you can't stop, just go on
Tell me without regrets

(Warn, warn, warn 'em 'bout that sign)
(Warn, warn, warn 'em 'bout that sign)
(Warn, warn, warn 'em 'bout that sign)
(Warn, warn, warn 'em 'bout that sign)
(Warn) Tell me without regrets

Amazing, this one-in-a-lifetime thrill
As if waking up from a deep dream
The feeling of facing the dazzling you
Even my restless eyes fall asleep next to you
A fleeting flashlight in the endless darkness
Make me forget my other thought

So let you know what you feel right now
Cut the chase and shine on me

So don't make me regret it
I wish every day was endless
My feelings for you
Don't let them get lost
Don't make me regret it
Woo, you started everything (Oh)
Woo, I'm ready to risk everything
Don't make me regret it
Woo, if you can't stop, just go on
Tell me without regrets

Look, if you leave me, I'll be lost
You're like my star in the sky
Maybe a little clich√© I'll spit out
I'm just saying what my heart tells me to
As if only you're painting other colors like a lie
The black-and-white world is colored by you
And it feels good, something's different this time

So don't make me regret it (Oh)
I wish every day was endless
My feelings for you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't let them get lost (*Be my light forever*)
Don't make me regret it
Woo, you started everything (**Ah, yeah, yeah**)
Woo, I'm ready to risk everything
Don't make me regret it
Woo, if you can't stop, just go on (**Regret it**)
Tell me without regrets (**Tell me**)

Woo, you started everything
Woo, I'm ready to risk everything
Dive in, heh
Tell me without regrets
