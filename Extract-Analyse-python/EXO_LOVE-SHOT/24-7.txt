“Bye” after sending you off at night
As expected I'm tossing and turning all night long
For the first time I wonder whether I’m weird
Why does this feel so different to me?
The countless days I spent alone
This air I had grown used to
In one moment it pushes right in
Like the light of the yellow lightbulb in my room
You warmed me up
I think about it 24/7
Even if I text you “sorry”, you aren't calling me
I think about it 24/7
I can't shake this empty feeling
It’s a long day ooh ooh
I dream next to you ooh ooh
You're all I think of 24/7
I'm burning up, going crazy, dying slowly
You're stuck in my head
And ice is stuck in your heart
What did you think of all day long?
Now it's time for me to hurt
Why are you fine all on your own
Saying you're not missing out?
You know everyone tells you you're too cold
Thinking you're too good for everyone else
You know it’s not nice, so you want to fix it
Even though it’s just you not being good to me
You're not cold, you’rejust bad to me
I think about it 24/7
Even if I text you “sorry”, you aren't calling me
I think about it 24/7
I can't shake this empty feeling
It's a long day ooh ooh
I dream next to you ooh ooh
You’re all I think of 24/7
I'm burning up, going crazy, dying slowly
The love movie scenes seemed so cliche
So why were you smiling at all of them?
I've changed since this started
And you put up with that too, didn't you?
I have nothing
And now I let the tears flow
I can't take a day, or even an hour
I miss you so much
I think about it 24/7
Even if I text you “sorry”, you aren't calling me
I think about it 24/7
I can't shake this empty feeling
It's a long day ooh ooh
I dream next to you ooh ooh
You're all I think of 24/7
I'm burning up, going crazy, dying slowly
24/7
