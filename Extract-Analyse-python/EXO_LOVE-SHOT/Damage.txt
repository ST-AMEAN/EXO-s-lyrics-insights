Ooh
Yo yo damage damage
Damage damage damage damage
Yeah okay okay
With a blank face you spit out another lie
Even knowing so, I’m shaken like it’s a habit
I can’t breathe, indulged in our memories
Faced with this deepening feeling of being lost
My beliefs collapse
A lie birthed by another lie
How much of it was actually you?
I keep just sighing
The scene in front of me grows blurry
Unknowingly in the dark night
You would give me the slip
And the anxiety is too endless
To just consider it a nightmare
In the end you wake me up in the darkness
Even if I try to hold on
It’s all your fault
You hurt me and keep making me hurt
It’s all your fault that the damage grew
You set off my flares (Every moment)
And the damage is too big to go back
You messed it up, and the darkness fell again
It’s all your fault that caused this damage
The moment you realize it went too far
I’ve already left you far behind, da-damage
Damage damage damage dam
The regret will get to you
Look how I’ve run out of patience
My expectations and obligations to you run dry
Wounds growing deeper the more we drew it out
You’ll feel it once I leave
Answer me, uh
Your true feelings hidden behind a faint smile
And now my heart is no no
Tonight the nerve wracking darkness
And the painful memories rage in my mind
In the end you wake me from the chaos
Even if I try to hold it in
It’s all your fault
You hurt me and keep making me hurt
It’s all your fault that the damage grew
You set off my flares (Every moment)
And the damage is too big to go back
You messed it up, and the darkness fell again
It’s all your fault that caused this damage
The moment you realize it went too far
I’ve already left you far behind, da-damage
It’s all over
We can’t go back, no no no
If I could meet someone else
And fall in love, yeah
The more I think about it
The wounds in my heart deepen and I know
That I can’t have any other love
E.X.O
It’s all your fault
(Baby all your fault)
You hurt me and keep making me hurt
It’s all your fault that the damage grew
You set off my flares (Every moment)
And the damage is too big to go back
You, the darkness overlaps and overlaps again
It’s all your fault that caused this damage
In the end it was me, but
I’ve already left you far behind, da-damage
Damage damage damage dam (No)
Damage damage damage dam (Yeah yeah)
Leave you behind, leave you behind
Da-damage
