Yeah
Woo-uh, woo-uh
Na-na-na-na
Da-da-da-da

You'll love me forever
That’s what you said, that's what you said to me
Those words linger around me
So how could I let you, let you go, baby?

I know that's not the case, that it’s over
But I still keep, still keep
Holding onto you with the same force
You try to leave me with

You said I was your future
Am I now just your past?
You said you only love me, that your heart
Would forever stay by my side
So I gave you my everything
And now you're leaving me
I'm still waiting for you, my heart will always
Draw you in like gravity

Your way of speaking, sentences, words
I remember every single one of them
The you of back then is still lingering around me
So how could l let you, let you go, baby?

The ‘lie' hidden in the word ‘believe'
I didn't see it
And now I still, I still
Am tricking myself into thinking
It's a lie that you lied to me

You said I was your future
Am I now just your past?
You said you only love me, that your heart
Would forever stay by my side
So I gave you my everything
And now you're leaving me
I’m still waiting for you, my heart will always
Draw you in like gravity

(Yeah, uh)
The bet I placed on you failed in the end
A race I was running on my own
Honey, look at me now
All that comes back is an echo without answer
Swirling around my head
You left me behind you, falling apart
And I’m scared I'll be left to drift without you

If it’s for you
I have the strength to move anything, you know that
But I can't do anything to your heart
Gravity, gravity, gravity

Yo, your weight, still drawing me in
Continuously swallows me whole
As time passes the wounds increase
And even our good memories hide their traces
Your figure left in my mind is just a lie
So what should I believe?
I can't be sure, never again
And I'm left yelling out after your back
Lingering

You said I was your future
Am I now just your past?
You said you only love me, that your heart
Would forever stay by my side
So I gave you my everything
And now you’re leaving me
I'm still waiting for you, you know how I feel
I trusted you, and then...
