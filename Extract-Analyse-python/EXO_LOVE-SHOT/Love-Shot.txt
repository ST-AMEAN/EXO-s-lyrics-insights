Staring coldly at one another
Your piercing voice is so suffocating
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Aye-ye

With your eyes closed shut
Our hearts closed off and stubbornly set in stone
Refusing to acknowledge it all

Ah I’m burning up
It’s so suffocating, I’m about to burst
I’m so thirsty
Fill this cup up
To the brink
On this dangerous night I

It's the love shot
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's the love shot
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's the love shot

Mixed up love and hate
My cherished memories
Are losing their color
And slipping away slowly

It’s deepening day by day, calm down (Calm down)
Those hurtful words (Words)
And damaged heart, where is love?
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

I tried to avoid it all
I've tried everything but I can't deny love
Too much ego satisfied my hunger
And left me with no compassion
Let's try filling it all up again

It's the love shot
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's the love shot
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's the love shot

People come and people go
You and I are standing here
Gradually getting used to these muted emotions

My heart is burning up
I'm parched
In trust I'm filling up this void with you
Lighting up a fire in my lifeless heart, yeah

It's the love shot
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's the love shot
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's the love shot
