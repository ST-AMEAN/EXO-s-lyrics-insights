It grows faint as time passes
Your face when you used to love me
Even if you hide it, it becomes clear
How you’re changing a bit at a time
I want to hear the truth now
Why do you keep heating around the bush round
Yeah, even if you act like it’s not, already
I can already see through it all

Like sand, the tighter I hold on
The more you scatter away

Our gazes missing each other
Doubts spreading in a way we can’t stop
Hiding a secret, your sign sign sign
Now stop it, don’t lie lie lie
It might set off a firework that will burn it all down
The words you thoughtlessly said to me, I know
It’s all a sign sign sign

Honestly you da true
Honestly you da true
Body talk when you move
Body talk when you move

Air trapped in the silence
I’m anxious, like walking on ice
Stop this endless nightmare
Before it’s too late
The answer I’m waiting for
You already know it
Don’t even think of letting it slide
Just push me away instead

The few slivers of hope I had
Are all broken apart

Our gazes missing each other
Doubts spreading in a way we can’t stop
Hiding a secret, your sign sign sign
Now stop it, don’t lie lie lie
It might set off a firework that will burn it all down
The words you thoughtlessly said to me, I know
It’s all a sign sign sign

In the end you’ll be trapped
In the secret room made of all your excuses
You keep getting caught in your own traps
Ringing a bell in your head, like ting
You were too late to realize, yah
My heart that was only for you
Turns into nothing but a pile of ash
So you can’t bring me back
I threw away all my memories of you
And it’s all a sign that this is the end

We went the wrong way
The fire spreading in a way we can’t stop
One by one, showing your sign sign signs
(One by one, I see your signs)
In the end, I found your lie lie lie
(Your lies that keep showing)
Saying that you love me might
Even burn down our break up, oh no
So now I’ll say bye bye bye

Honestly you da true
Honestly you da true
Body talk when you move
Body talk when you move
Honestly you da true
Honestly you da true
Body talk when you move
Body talk when you move
