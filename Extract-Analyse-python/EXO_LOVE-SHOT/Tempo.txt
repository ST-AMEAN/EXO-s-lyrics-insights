I can't believe
I’ve been waiting for this feeling (Oh-oh-oh)
I wanna be the only one hearing her, she's my melody
All day, go on and on and, oh
So she won't leave, I want her by my side (Yeah, uh)

Don’t mess up my tempo (Tempo, yeah)
Listen, this will be enough (Nah)
I said don't mess up my tempo
This beat will steal her heart, uh
It's one of a kind
To the rhythm, one, two, three, uh (Yeah)
Don't mess up my tempo
Can't stop this attraction (Oh)

You're so charming, you're lovely
There's nothing separating us
Heart beat becoming unstable
Just close your eyes trust me (Woo)

Get ready ahead of time to go out, are you ready?
I’m going to rule the city today and bring the sparks
You’re already out, why are you so shy, ma boo?
Don't stutter, you don’t have to feel awkward
You don't have to bring anything, just hold my hand my lady
Every road we walk on is a red carpet and a runway
The way you walk is so unique
Match the speed now, tempo

Baby girl, your wake-up call in the morning makes me flutter
I'm missing you even though I see you every day
From right now, you and me, let's get down
Everything is perfect, I like it
So don’t slow it up for me (Uh)

Don't mess up my tempo
Listen, this will be enough
I said don't mess up my tempo
This beat will steal her heart, uh
It's one of a kind
To this rhythm, one, two, three, uh
Don't mess up my tempo
Can't stop this attraction

Look around lovely
There's nothing separating us
It's fixed on you, this heart beat
Do as you want, teach me (Uh, ooh-ooh)

This is my area, don't test me
Send me a message if you don't want to be by yourself
Now you got me flexin'
Look around
The Great Gatsby in that crew that's watching you (Hold on, wow)
I'm doing alright baby girl you don't know
Get rid of that question mark above your head
I don't use the word L.I.E
You're already naturally following my tempo

Baby girl, leaning on my shoulder
Your scent is inside my heart
Striking like a wave
I want to be forever like this
So don't mess up my tempo, baby
Don't slow it up for me

Don't mess up my tempo
Don't mess up my tempo
Don't mess up my tempo
Don't mess up my (Whoa-oh)
Don't mess up my tempo
Don't mess up my tempo
Don't mess up my tempo

Look into my eyes and tell me
So that I'm the only one that can hear it
Say that you love only me
Say that I'm the only one
So that you won't falter anymore
So that no one can take you away
So that no one will be able to touch you
I will protect you from beside you

Dum-dum-dum-dum
Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum
Can you feel my heart?
Surrounding and hugging me, you're my one and only savior
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Everyone's looking at you

I can't believe, I can't believe, I can't believe
I've been waiting for this feeling
I want to be the only one hearing her, she's my melody
All day,go on and on and, oh
So that she can't leave, keep her by my side

Don't mess up my tempo
Listen, this will be enough
I said don't mess up my tempo
Totally different kind of beat, uh
You can't find it elsewhere
This is perfect, one, two, three, uh
Don't mess up my tempo
Can't stop this attraction
