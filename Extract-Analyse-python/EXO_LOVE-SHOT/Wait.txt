What are you thinking of?
I'm thinking of you
My world is filled with you
Can you remember? How we were so excited this time of year, babe
In the white season that seemed to shine brighter that year
It blew in the past that shut window
Could you understand how I feel as I stay in place
Imagining you all day as I wait
It looks like it could snow (already, look outside)
You can't be too late (promise me)
So I don't accidentally miss you on my way
Now all I do (all I do)
All I do is wait
You got cold so easily
Telling me you were used to catching colds
But I hope this winter will be kind to you
You know, that's one of my wishes, baby
Why do I miss you so much more today?
I hesitantly looked through memories of you
And it's bearable, because in the pictures
Your face is smiling back at me
It looks like it could snow (already, look outside)
You can't be too late (promise me)
So I don't accidentally miss you on my way
Now all I do (all I do)
All I do is wait
I'm waiting for you, wait
I'm waiting for you, wait
I'm waiting for you
You
It looks like it could snow
You can't be too late (promise me)
So I don't accidentally miss you on my way
Now all I do (all I do)
All I do
Oh all I do (all I do)
All I do
All I do
All I do is wait
