I can’t believe
The whole world is crazy about her (Oh)
Can't help but care
About the melody that lingers in my ears
Repeating memories go on and on and oh
Following this melody, capturing your traces (Yeah)

Uh, don’t mess up my tempo (Don't do it)
Accept it, listen carefully (Yah)
I said don’t mess up my tempo
This is my weapon that steals hearts (This is my weapon that steals hearts, uh)
Don't mess up my tempo, unique, 1, 2, 3 (Ay, yeah)
Don’t mess up my tempo
She's my exclusive melody (Oh)

So lovely being with you
The narrow streets have magic
My heartbeat becomes irregular
Close your eyes and listen, trust me (Woohoo)

It's not time yet
I'll wait here, are you ready? (Look)
Let's cultivate a bit of understanding
Between this city and me (Aw)
Don't be shy, nobody is ever ready, yeah, ma boo (*Ah*)
No need, want to be bad, want to be good, why bother (Coming out)
Oh hold my hand, follow me
I'll show you my lady
Wherever we go, rose petals are scattered
Walking like a legend (*Swish*)
Girl we just ride now to the beat my tempo (*Aw*)

Baby girl, your morning call
Makes my world start
Even though we see each other every day, I still miss you every second
Let's get down from now on
Everything is so good it's hard to believe
So don't slow it up for me

Uh, don’t mess up my tempo
Accept it, listen carefully
I said don’t mess up my tempo
This is my weapon that steals hearts
Don't mess up my tempo, unique 1, 2, 3
Don’t mess up my tempo
She's my exclusive melody (Don't mess up my tempo)

You enchant me, lovely (Oh, oh, oh)
The more resistance, the more powerless it becomes
Even if it's intense, it's okay
As long as it's what you want, teach me

Don't test me on my turf (Woo-ooh)
If you feel uneasy being alone, message me (Oh, yeah)
Now you got me flexin'
Look clearly now
I'm the great Gatsby of this exciting street (Hold on, wow)
I'm doing alright, baby girl, you don't know (You don't)
Throw away all the question marks on your face (What?)
There is no L. I. E in my dictionary
You haven't noticed yet
But you've already stepped into my tempo

Baby girl, when you lean on my face and breathe (Tell me, baby girl, on my face and breathe)
That breath causes endless ripples (Endless ripples)
Suddenly attacking me like a whirlpool (Attacking)
Hope time stops right now
So don’t mess up my tempo, baby
Don’t slow it up for me

Don’t mess up my tempo
Don’t mess up my tempo
Don’t mess up my tempo
Don’t mess up my (Now hold on)
Don’t mess up my tempo
Don’t mess up my tempo
Don’t mess up my tempo

Please look into my eyes and tell me
Whisper in my ear (Ooh, mhm)
Tell me you only want to love me
Tell me you only belong to me
Don't listen to hearsay anymore (Oh, oh, oh)
I will never let you be tempted by anyone (Oh, oh, oh)
If an opponent appears, I will not hesitate (Oh, oh)
I will be the one to protect you

Dum dum dum dum
Dum dum dum dum dum
Can you feel it
Feel my heartbeat (Feel my heartbeat)
You surrounding me
Exclusive, only savior (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
The whole world pauses
All eyes are on you

I can’t believe (I can't believe; I can't believe)
The whole world is crazy about her (Crazy about her)
Can't help but care
About the melody that lingers in my ears
Repeating memories go on and on and oh
Following this melody, capturing your traces (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Uh, don’t mess up my tempo
Accept it, listen carefully (Don't mess up my tempo, baby)
I said don’t mess up my tempo (My tempo)
This is my weapon that steals hearts (Hoo-hoo)
Don't mess up my tempo, unique 1, 2, 3 (Perfect, 1, 2, 3, yeah)
Don’t mess up my tempo
She's my exclusive melody (She's my exclusive melody, no)
