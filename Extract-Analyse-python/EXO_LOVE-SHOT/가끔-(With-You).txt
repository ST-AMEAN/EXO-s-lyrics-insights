When I look at the stars shining brightly
It almost feels like I’m looking at you
You’re like everything that shines bright
When the night sky grows dark
The whole world is sparkled with light
Naturally you grab my hand
And before I know it you start sparkling with my colors
Sometimes I think
When I see you laughing brightly
That your eyes and lips and everything else
Seem to look like me
It’s like your pitch black eyes take in my light
And shine just as brightly as I do
Sometimes I see myself when I look at you
Tonight it feels like I won’t be able to sleep
But I never knew it would feel this nice
Especially when I’m able to spend time
Imagining you, yeah
We talk all night long
Asking about how each others days were
And when you say this is the best part
I shine even brighter thanks to you
Sometimes I think
When I see you laughing brightly
That your eyes and lips and everything else
Seem to look like me
It’s like your pitch black eyes take in my light
And shine just as brightly as I do
Sometimes I see myself when I look at you
Every single day I’m looking after you
And you’re looking at me
And like a mirror every expression
Aven the way you speak, feels like it’s me
Bit by bit you and I are becoming one
Wondering what I seem like in your world
Like a habit, I find myself in your eyes
The night grows late as I stare at you
And I want to stop time
To keep you in my eyes even longer, for me
Sometimes I think
When I see you seeming like me
That every single small thing
Was me being like you
Promise me now
When all the lights are gone
That just like tonight
You’ll forever be shining with me
Love you
