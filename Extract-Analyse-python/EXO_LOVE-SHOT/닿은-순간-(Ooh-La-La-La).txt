When I turn my head, my eyes meet yours
And once again, you’re staring at you
That smile is a bit too much for me
Filled with an ease leaving me to burn
I can’t breathe when I see your eye smile
It seems like you know that’s your charm
Yeah, yeah, yeah

La la la la
Your eyes are whispering to me
La la la la
It’s like they’re asking me to approach

Ooh la la la, please allow me
Ooh la la la, into your imagination
I’ll go right in, so let me in
I’ll dance in your eyes
Ooh la la la, the moment our gazes meet

Right now, in this moment, the space between us
Is filled with this strong trembling
Becoming a rhythm and drawing me in
Let your body move to it however you’d like
Yeah, she knows
An odd smile that doesn’t let on
Seeing through the curiosity driving me on
And sending a sign
Yeah, yeah, yeah

La la la la
It’s like you’re telling me to open the door
La la la la (Yeah yeah)
To your slightly open heart and come right in

Ooh la la la
Please allow me (Yeah me)
Ooh la la la
Into your imagination (In your imagination)
I’ll go right in, so let me in (Yeah)
I’ll dance in your eyes (Dance)
Ooh la la la (Yeah)
The moment our gazes meet *(Yeah, yeah, hey)*

Should I really try making a move now?
What should be the first thing l say?
The moment l hesitate, thinking it over
You get up and walk away
Even as I look at your bold back from far away
Your slow pace is telling me to follow
Girl just tell me what you like
It’s like you’re telling me to hurry

Ooh la la la
Please allow me (Allow it)
Ooh la la la
Into your reality (Whoa, into reality)
I’ll approach you, so hold on to me (Oh)
Tell me that you were waiting
Ooh la la la
*The moment l reached you* (The moment it touched)

Ah hoo, now I approach you
Ah hoo, you and I have grown closer
