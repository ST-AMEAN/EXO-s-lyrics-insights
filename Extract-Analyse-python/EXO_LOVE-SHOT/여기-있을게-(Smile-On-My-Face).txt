In the faint memories
Even now those are still pretty vague
Even your name that I kept following isn’t appearing
That day was so clear
Maybe you’re a heartbreaker
I’m sure you made my heart hurt
If you look at me like nothing happened
Then I guess everything’s fine now
I just happened to meet you
You’re like that again in white disappearance
You pass by just like the wind
You disappear naturally
I did it all with a smile on my face
The traces have disappeared in my memories
Maybe they’ll come back to me
But I’ll just smile and send them back
I did it all with a smile on my face
No one has to be hurt
I don’t grab onto you as you go away
I want to send you off with a smile
With a smile on my face
I stood there blankly for a long time
I weakly look at you who is far
I don’t understand why I’m like this
Just like the day, I let you go
I asked you “Why?”
But you just hugged me without saying anything
That was when I knew it was our end
That’s how you got far away
Actually, everything about you is so clear
Your name, your eyes, everything
(Your eyes, everything)
The memories of me loving you
They just bury inside my heart naturally
I did it all with a smile on my face
The traces have disappeared in my memories
Maybe they’ll come back to me
But I’ll just smile and send them back
I did it all with a smile on my face
No one has to be hurt
I don’t grab onto you as you go away
I want to send you off with a smile
With a smile on my face
If you want, I’ll just stay, I’ll just stay
Here like this, I’ll just stay, I’ll just stay
