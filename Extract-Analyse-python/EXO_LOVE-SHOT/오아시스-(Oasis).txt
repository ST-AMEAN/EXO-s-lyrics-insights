Where every splendid thing gathered as if to tempt me
I thought that was the whole world
Breaths quickening
Eyes busy searching for the answers
My lips are drying out
On this endless road

We'll go a bit further, even further
On this road with a long way to go still
Runnin’, I'm runnin'
Chasing the sun
For a long day

Run, run
Run, run

I realized that every man-made road eventually comes to an end
And there’s you, asking me for the answer
You go your own way, you don't have to stop
Don't keep track of our direction
The more we wander, the thirstier we get, yeah, yeah
Past the red desert
We've found an oasis

And we go further, even further
On this road with a long way to go still
Runnin', I'm runnin'
Chasing the sun
For a long day

Run, run
Run, run

We'll go further, even further
Finding a road never taken before
Runnin’, I’m runnin'
Chasing the sun
Yeah, I’m on the road

I'm thirsting for somewhere
Somewhere even further
With this burning thirst, oh

We'll go further, even further
Finding a road never taken before
Runnin', I’m runnin'
Chasing the sun
For a long day

Run, run
Run, run

We'll go further, even further
Finding a road never taken before
Runnin', I'm runnin'
Chasing the sun
Yeah, I'm on the road

Run, run (I'm on the road)
Run (Yeah), run
Yeah, I'm on the road
