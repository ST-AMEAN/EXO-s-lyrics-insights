This nerve-wracking slicence
You blow in on it
At some point, at some point
Even if I try to catch some sleep
It runs further away from me
All of my good memories
Are dyed in the color of regrets
I can't believe you’re not here with me
The clock sounds even Iouder than usual
After turning the lights out, if I lay down
And close my eyes, it quietly blows in
Woo, I think this is you
You start flying all around me
Woo, the empty sound of the wind
Gradually becomes a storm
It was too quiet, and so the bad dreams
Come to me as if to swallow me whole
I'm paralyzed, unable to move
Trapped inside of you raging around me
All of my feelings, all at once
Our break up, all at once
Strike me now, all at once
I'm inside of you as you rage around me
I said goodbye, thinking that was the only choice
Putting an end to it
Someone please just stop me back then
Oh no no no
Even if I say that wasn’t how I really felt
Your heart is probably all closed off now
Blowing past the point of no return
Your sharp breath stabs into me
Woo, I think this is you
You start to hurt me
Woo, and only now
Do I realize that it's really over
It was too quiet, and so the bad dreams
Come to me as if to swallow me whole
I'm paralyzed, unable to move
(So I can't see)
Trapped inside of you raging around me
All of my feelings, all at once
Our break up, all at once
Strike me now, all at once
I'm inside of you as you rage around me
Realizing I'm unable to let you go
After all this time
Even if you know this is happening, act like you don't
It feels like just yesterday
Even if time has passed, you're drawn in my mind
And spread
It was too quiet, and so the bad dreams
(Bit by bit to me)
Come to me as if to swallow me whole
(Come ti me as if to swallow me)
I’m paralyzed, unable to move
Trapped inside of you raging around me
(Trapped inside of you)
All of my feelings, all at once
Our break up, all at once
Strike me now, all at once
(Now here baby)
I’m inside of you as you rage around me
I told you to live well
Told you to forget me
I want to, too
But it won't go as I like
I’ll use all my strength to make it through
And when the wind calms
I'll smile like you used to
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
