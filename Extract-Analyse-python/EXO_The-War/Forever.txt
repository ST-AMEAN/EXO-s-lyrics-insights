You could be my only star
You could be the moonlight
Just like this, let’s be forever, forever
Forever
Forever
Girl you know you got me up
Believe me, my heart is racing like crazy
That’s all mine
Yeah, I was wandering and
Found the pin ball
Make me feel so, nothing can
Compare with how you make me feel
Even if we can’t find the edge of this universe
It’s strange, because I can feel you
No matter wherе you are
‘Cause you
You could be my only star
You could bе the moonlight
You’re all I need in my world forever
I run to you, through the darkness
I’ll hold you close to me through this crazy race
Let’s make it forever, ever
Don’t disappear, this is the end for me
We’ll never find a love like this again
Don’t break my soul
Your gaze, words, and everything forever
Forever
When the morning finds us
I’ll cover you warmly with my whole body
Hold me close to you, too
Even if the sun rises, without you I’m cold
(No matter where you are)
Even if I’m soaked in rain, I’m thirsty thirsty
I run to you, through the darkness
I’ll hold you close to me through this crazy race
Let’s make it forever, ever
Don’t disappear, this is the end for me
We’ll never find a love like this again
Don’t break my soul
Your gaze, words, and everything forever
Only let me see you
Come into my arms so nobody can touch you
Let me hold you
Just like this, let’s be forever, forever
Forever
Forever
Yo, nice skirt You push me up to the mound
Pitcher go, she’s the baddest one around the town
Put it to work, you shine like metal
In front of her, I can’t help but be shallow
She gets it all, she’s tonight’s top celeb
Hit me and we’re going hard
Now it’s official, let everyone know you’re mine
Something completely raw
Hold up, I let go of it all
You’re all I have left
Let’s take this to the end, rock and roller
We have the same fate, the quarter’s already been tossed
You’re the controller that moves me
Feel our soul, forever, I’ll run to you
I run to you, through the darkness
I’ll hold you close to me through this crazy race
Let’s make it forever, ever
Don’t disappear, this is the end for me
We’ll never find a love like this again
(Never find a love like this again)
Don’t break my soul
Your gaze, words, and everything forever
