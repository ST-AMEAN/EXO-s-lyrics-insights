Shimmy-shimmy, ko ko bop, I think I like it
Let your guard down, down
Don't be embarrassed
I work my way into your dizzy heart
Spread through you softly, like something familiar

(Ah-ooh) It's a calm night
(Ah-ooh) A night all for you
Unable to help it, I fall for you, yeah, yeah
I get drunk on your movements, yeah, yeah
Forget what you knew about me today
Hidden instincts shimmy up

It goes down, down, baby
Leave your body to the rhythm
It goes down, down, baby
Let it go and scream
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
We go oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

We goin' ko ko bop
(Hey!)

Shimmy-shimmy, ko ko bop, I think I like it
Bit by bit, let it down, down
Don't be shy, don't mind what anyone says
Just be beautiful like you are right now
I want time to stop like this, baby, are you down?

(Ah-ooh) It's our last night
(Ah-ooh) A night just for us
Don't be nervous and come to me, yeah, yeah
Leave it all to me, yeah, yeah
Slowly losing control, let it all go today
Don't care what anyone else thinks, shaking up

It goes down, down, baby
Leave your body to the rhythm
It goes down, down, baby
Let it go and scream
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
We're oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Break it down now (Hey!)
We go down now (Listen!)

In the deep night you shine even brighter
Your eyes (Yo-yo) tell me everything (Yo-yo)
I want you on this great night (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
I know, it's okay, start now
Let's go, *it's about to go, go*

Down, down, baby (It's going down)
Leave your body to the rhythm
It goes down, down, baby (It's going down)
Let it go and scream
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
We're oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Goin' ko ko bop (Goin' ko ko bop)

Down, down, baby (Down, down, down, yeah)
Whisper by my ear
It goes down, down, baby (We're going down, yeah)
My heart, make it burn
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
I'm going crazy oh-oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Goin' ko ko bop
