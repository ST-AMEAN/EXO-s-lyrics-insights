Yeah I want it, yeah I need it
Without warning, you came into my arms
If you tease me, however you want
Like a fool, I start to smile
How can I explain you?
You’re different, you, so much, you
All your laughter and even your habits
They’re all so lovable, say yeah
What U do?
Like this, I love you
What U do?
Got me like, got me like
Love you right
Baby, time for just us two
What U do?
Like this, I love you
Never change any part of you
Always look at me with those eyes
No need for a reason
I just need you alone
Baby we can go higher
Your thoughts and long talks
Sharе them, you, only to me, you
I wanna wrap around you tonight
Carefully, say yеah
What U do?
Like this, I love you
What U do?
Got me like, got me like
Love you right
Baby, time for just us two
(Let’s stay up all night)
What U do?
Like this, I love you
Who are you? You make me dizzy
Baby you’re so beautiful
Come closer, so I can feel you more
I wanna go closer
What U do?
Like this, I love you
What U do?
Got me like, got me like
Love you right
Baby, time for just us two
(Let’s stay up all night)
What U do?
Like this, I love you
I love you
Love you right
Let’s stay up all night, what
I love you, I love you
Yeah yeah ooh ooh
