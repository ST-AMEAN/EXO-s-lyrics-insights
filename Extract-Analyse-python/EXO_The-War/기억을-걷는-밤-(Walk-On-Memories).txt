A voice that came to you on light some day
Unknowingly waking you up with a whisper like a kiss
Your eyes slowly open filled with dreams
And you smile at me like you’d been waiting, yeah
I lightly sit next to you and say hi
I want to try to go back to that beautiful time
Following the faded memories
I’ll come take you away tonight
We walk along this exciting path together
Covered in stars shining white
Before the sleeping world reflected clearly
In your eyes opens its eyes
So nobody knows
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Walk all night long
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
This path spreading out wherever we reach
I want to walk along it with you on this beautiful night
I pass through the tunnel of time I spent longing for you
And was given another chance to return to you
You’re just like you are in my memories
Both your lovely voice and your eyes like dawn
I lightly kiss the back of your small hand
I want to try to leave on a new journey
Following the melody I can hear clearly from far away
I’ll come take you away tonight
We walk along this exciting path together
Covered in stars shining white
Before the sleeping world reflected clearly
In your eyes opens its eyes
So nobody knows
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Walk all night long
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
This path spreading out wherever we reach
I want to walk along it with you on this beautiful night
As the end of this path draws closer
When an old prayer reaches us
The tomorrow we’ve dreamed of
Will spread out brightly in front of us
Blinding, golden sunlight spills over us
And you’re so beautiful, shining brightly
(Shining brightly yeah)
That I keep my eyes on you and take it all in
Before this sleeping world opens its eyes
Now open your eyes
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Don’t forget
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Someday I’ll want to walk by your side
Along this path on
A beautiful night
A beautiful night
