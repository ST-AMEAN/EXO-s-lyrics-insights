It washes over me like rising fog
I'm running out of breath, it’s killing me
My scars are getting deeper, it keeps hurting
(But it was you)
I remember the nightmare of that day
But it's not like that this time
You're fading away
Don’t know what you want
The fog has lifted and things get clear
All the lies pass by like a reel of film
I hate you
Woo, I'm going crazy
Only a thick scar called you remains
Not even able to erase it
I'm going crazy
Your face looks like nothing's wrong
Baby, won't you stop?
Your excuses are useless
You drive me crazy
The moment I blink, I get cut
At the tip of your sharp tongue, just one moment
My eyes, ears, hands, feet, so much more
What have I seen and heard till now?
Is my body even my own? I can't control it
The fog has lifted and things get clear
All the lies pass by like a reel of film
I hate you
Woo, I'm going crazy
Only a thick scar called you remains
Not even able to erase it
I'm going crazy
Going crazy
(Go go going crazy)
My heart is racing as if it’ll explode
I wanna know what’s next
Adrenaline rush, spreading all throughout my body
Don't know what you do to me Oh
The decision my rationale tells me is just one
But my heart is shaking
Call me crazy but I still want you
Up and down like a rollercoaster
Have I not learned my lesson yet?
I’m falling into a tornado filled swamp
I'm flailing, three times, four times, keeps repeating
I hate you
Woo, I'm going crazy
Only a thick scar called you remains
Not even able to erase it
I'm going crazy
Going crazy (Go go going crazy)
I hate you
Woo, I’m going crazy
Upside down, you flip me inside out
I can't stop now
I'm going crazy
