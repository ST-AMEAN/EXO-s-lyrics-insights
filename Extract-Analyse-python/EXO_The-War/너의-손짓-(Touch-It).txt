Yeah yeah yeah uh
No word can replace you
No need, no word can express you
Don’t need anything else, just need you
Nothing else, yes, only you
Your breathtaking silhouette
You’re as beautiful as a painting
Even your smallest movements
That drive me crazy
When you softly brush back your hair
Your sexy hand gesture, baby
Your hand gesture
It’s obvious I want you
Lost, hand gesture, baby
My hand gesture
Ay and she goes like
Nana nana nanana
Nana nana nanana
Ay all the girls go
Nana nana nanana
Nana nana nanana
Oh yeah
You’re in front of me right now, feeling good now
(Feeling good now) Yeah I’m feeling good now
My head goes boom, what should I say?
What what, my head isBlack out uh
You drive up my imagination
Drawing out hundreds of images of you
All your small movements are like your voice
When you softly brush back your hair
Your sexy hand gesture, baby
Your hand gesture
It’s obvious I want you
Lost, hand gesture, baby
My hand gesture
All my ladies say yeah
Nana nana nanana
Ay with one voice, feel me
Nana nana nanana
All my ladies say yeah
Nana nana nanana
(Yo yo) Sing it again
Nana nana nanana
No need to have
A great reason
Even with your little hand gesture
You squeeze and shake me
(Shake me babe)
Oh you got what I want (Ay ay)
I only need you
(That’s all babe)
Oh you got what I want (Ay ay)
I only need you by my side
I don’t wanna regret it
I can’t help myself
I try to act indifferent
Try not to make it obvious
But without knowing, I’m falling for you
Without knowing, your two eyes
Are looking toward me
Did you think I wouldn’t notice?
(Tell me if you want me)
When you softly brush back your hair
Your sexy hand gesture, baby
Your hand gesture
It’s obvious I want you
Lost, hand gesture, baby
My hand gesture
Sing it, sing it baby
Nana nana nanana
Nana nana nanana
Nana nana nanana
(Ay) C’mon c’mon do it again
Nana nana nanana
Be with me
Nana nana nanana
(Your white hands)
Sometimes tempt me
Sometimes act indifferent
(Oh) Your hand gestures
Takes my breath away
(Show me more of you)
Oh as if I’ll pass you by
(Watch it baby)
As if I’ll approach you
(Watch it baby woo)
My hand gestures
Make you stop
