A deeper burning fire, doesn’t know how to stop
Heat spreading all over, enduring the test of time
Feels like I’m born again, dazzling and shining
Everyone holds their hand out
But I’ll only show you, oh
Measure the worth (Measure the worth)
It’s a clearer chance (Wooh)
How dare you compare me (Uh huh)
You can’t handle me
Blow up (Blow up) Right in front of you
We glow up (Glow up) Everyone wants me
We drive ’em crazy crazy
We do it daily daily
We shine so much that we are blinding, we be
Shinin’ shinin’ just likе a diamond
Blindin’ blindin’ you like a diamond
Shinin’ shinin’ just like a diamond
Blindin’ blindin’ you like a diamond
Shinin’ shinin’ just likе a diamond
Blindin’ blindin’ you like a diamond
I’m not gonna avoid it (No no)
The more I clash and break
The clarity grows
I become more complete
I can’t get any more flashy
Now forever, I’ll stay by your side
Never changing, oh
I’m complete (I’m complete)
Even more perfectly (Even more perfectly)
Once they put their guards down (What?)
I’ll break down common sense
Blow up (Blow up) Right in front of you
We glow up (Glow up) The realness comes out
We drive ’em crazy crazy
We do it daily daily
We shine so much that we are blinding, we be
Shinin’ shinin’ just like a diamond
Blindin’ blindin’ you like a diamond
Shinin’ shinin’ just like a diamond
Blindin’ blindin’ you like a diamond
Oh if you want baby (If you want)
Baby, I’ll self authenticate myself for you
My value is forever
I’m finding my place (I’m finding)
Shine on, shine on
I’m finding my place (I’m finding)
Shine on, shine on
That light is only one (Shine on)
Shine on, shine on, shine on
I’m complete (I’m complete)
Even more perfectly (Even more perfectly)
Once they put their guards down (So what?)
I’ll break down common sense
Blow up (Blow up) Right in front of you
We glow up (Glow up) Everyone wants me
We drive ’em crazy crazy
We do it daily daily
We shine so much that we are blinding, we be
Shinin’ shinin’ (Like a what)
Just like a diamond
Blindin’ blindin’ (Like a what)
You like a diamond
Shinin’ shinin’ just like a diamond
Blindin’ blindin’ you like a diamond
Shinin’ shinin’ just like a diamond
