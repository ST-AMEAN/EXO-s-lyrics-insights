Tonight, for no reason
I feel strange, oh no
A silhouette appears in the faint light
Then my body hardens
If not now
I can’t ever escape from you
I try running away with all my strength
But I can’t
What I do do do do do
You’re beautiful that’s why I’m afraid
A deep trap, you’re looking at me
I’m already tied up
And going to you
When I see you, when I see you
I keep getting chills
I’m feeling something way more dangerous than love
Coming right at me
Your face is something between
Expressionless and a child’s smile
That risky difference of temperature
Will I be able to handle you?
You’re beautiful that’s why I’m afraid
A deep trap, you’re looking at me
I’m already tied up
And going to you
When I see you, when I see you
I keep getting chills
Yeah I like darkness, the thicker it gets
Because it shows all, Show ya (Show ya)
Babe (Show ya)
Yeah, don’t smile like that
When I see you, feels like you’re reading my mind
I keep getting chills
I try pushing you away with cold words
But you can’t be pushed
My heart keeps wanting you
You keep digging into me as if I’m already addicted
Like a maze, there’s no exit
I try running the opposite way but in the end
I go to you
You’re hovering over my head like blanche
Your touch passes me, bewitching me
Though I know it’s a bit dangerous
I can’t escape, you’re like caffeine
Now I have to accept it
Your eyes, body, words, voice, everything
I can’t escape
When I snap out of it
I find myself calling out to you
You’re beautiful that’s why I’m afraid
A deep trap, you’re looking at me
I’m already tied up
And going to you
