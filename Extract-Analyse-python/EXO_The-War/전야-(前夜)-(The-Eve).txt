Look at me, what’s the situation?
Past your flustered face
I see the walls crumbling down
And gradually, dawn is coming
It’s connecting endlessly
Can’t cut it off with this dull blade
So the problem keeps repeating
Like homework that can’t be solved

Fallen in front of a high wall
The small and weak sound of the wind
Gets entangled and turns into a storm
Listen to it

We must break it apart and clash against it
So we can see ourselves
We must shout out loud
So it spreads wide and far
The moment soft lights spread out
And chases away the darkness
We must wake up again
To the new morning

They look at me with arrogance
Already sitting at a different start line
The distance is far, yeah
As if our shouts won’t be heard

Countless and earnest dreams
That grew as they were trampled
Blossomed over the wall, confidently
Look at that scene

We must break it apart and clash against it
So we can see ourselves
We must shout out loud
So it spreads wide and far
The moment soft lights spread out
And chases away the darkness
We must wake up again
To the new morning

Distorted truths, the lies that were taught
A voice of change, a wave is rising
The one to create an ocean that will swallow it all
It’s you

We must break it apart and clash against it
So we can see ourselves
We must shout out loud
So it spreads wide and far
The moment soft lights spread out
And chases away the darkness
We must wake up again
To the new morning
