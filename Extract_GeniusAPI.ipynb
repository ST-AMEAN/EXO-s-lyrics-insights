       "      <td>Past your flustered face I see the walls crumbling down And gradually, dawn is coming It’s connecting endlessly Can’t cut it off with this dull blade So the problem keeps repeating Like homework that can’t be solved  Fallen in front of a high wall The small and weak sound of the wind Gets entangled and turns into a storm Listen to it  We must break it apart and clash against it So we can see ourselves We must shout out loud So it spreads wide and far The moment soft lights spread out And chases away the darkness We must wake up again To the new morning  They look at me with arrogance Already sitting at a different start line The distance is far, yeah As if our shouts won’t be heard  Countless and earnest dreams That grew as they were trampled Blossomed over the wall, confidently Look at that scene  We must break it apart and clash against it So we can see ourselves We must shout out loud So it spreads wide and far The moment soft lights spread out And chases away the darkness We must wake up again To the new morning  Distorted truths, the lies that were taught A voice of change, a wave is rising The one to create an ocean that will swallow it all It’s you  We must break it apart and clash against it So we can see ourselves We must shout out loud So it spreads wide and far The moment soft lights spread out And chases away the darkness We must wake up again To the new morning</td>\n",

You said you only love me, that your heart Would forever stay by my side So I gave you my everything And now you’re leaving me I'm still waiting for you, you know how I feel I trusted you, and then...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "16  As expected I'm tossing and turning all night long For the first time I wonder whether I’m weird Why does this feel so different to me? The countless days I spent alone This air I had grown used to In one moment it pushes right in Like the light of the yellow lightbulb in my room You warmed me up I think about it 24/7 Even if I text you “sorry”, you aren't calling me I think about it 24/7 I can't shake this empty feeling It’s a long day ooh ooh I dream next to you ooh ooh You're all I think of 24/7 I'm burning up, going crazy, dying slowly You're stuck in my head And ice is stuck in your heart What did you think of all day long? Now it's time for me to hurt Why are you fine all on your own Saying you're not missing out? You know everyone tells you you're too cold Thinking you're too good for everyone else You know it’s not nice, so you want to fix it Even though it’s just you not being good to me You're not cold, you’rejust bad to me I think about it 24/7 Even if I text you “sorry”, you aren't calling me I think about it 24/7 I can't shake this empty feeling It's a long day ooh ooh I dream next to you ooh ooh You’re all I think of 24/7 I'm burning up, going crazy, dying slowly The love movie scenes seemed so cliche So why were you smiling at all of them? I've changed since this started And you put up with that too, didn't you?

I’m falling into a tornado filled swamp I'm flailing, three times, four times, keeps repeating I hate you Woo, I'm going crazy Only a thick scar called you remains Not even able to erase it I'm going crazy Going crazy (Go go going crazy) I hate you Woo, I’m going crazy Upside down, you flip me inside out I can't stop now I'm going crazy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "31  Past your flustered face I see the walls crumbling down And gradually, dawn is coming It’s connecting endlessly Can’t cut it off with this dull blade So the problem keeps repeating Like homework that can’t be solved  Fallen in front of a high wall The small and weak sound of the wind Gets entangled and turns into a storm Listen to it  We must break it apart and clash against it So we can see ourselves We must shout out loud So it spreads wide and far The moment soft lights spread out And chases away the darkness We must wake up again To the new morning  They look at me with arrogance Already sitting at a different start line The distance is far, yeah As if our shouts won’t be heard  Countless and earnest dreams That grew as they were trampled Blossomed over the wall, confidently Look at that scene  We must break it apart and clash against it So we can see ourselves We must shout out loud So it spreads wide and far The moment soft lights spread out And chases away the darkness We must wake up again To the new morning  Distorted truths, the lies that were taught A voice of change, a wave is rising The one to create an ocean that will swallow it all It’s you  We must break it apart and clash against it So we can see ourselves We must shout out loud So it spreads wide and far The moment soft lights spread out And chases away the darkness We must wake up again To the new morning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "

You said you only love me, that your heart Would forever stay by my side So I gave you my everything And now you’re leaving me I'm still waiting for you, you know how I feel I trusted you, and then...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

      "16  As expected I'm tossing and turning all night long For the first time I wonder whether I’m weird Why does this feel so different to me? The countless days I spent alone This air I had grown used to In one moment it pushes right in Like the light of the yellow lightbulb in my room You warmed me up I think about it 24/7 Even if I text you “sorry”, you aren't calling me I think about it 24/7 I can't shake this empty feeling It’s a long day ooh ooh I dream next to you ooh ooh You're all I think of 24/7 I'm burning up, going crazy, dying slowly You're stuck in my head And ice is stuck in your heart What did you think of all day long? Now it's time for me to hurt Why are you fine all on your own Saying you're not missing out?

I’m falling into a tornado filled swamp I'm flailing, three times, four times, keeps repeating I hate you Woo, I'm going crazy Only a thick scar called you remains Not even able to erase it I'm going crazy Going crazy (Go go going crazy) I hate you Woo, I’m going crazy Upside down, you flip me inside out I can't stop now I'm going crazy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

      "16  As expected I'm tossing and turning all night long For the first time I wonder whether I’m weird Why does this feel so different to me? The countless days I spent alone This air I had grown used to In one moment it pushes right in Like the light of the yellow lightbulb in my room You warmed me up I think about it 24/7 Even if I text you “sorry”, you aren't calling me I think about it 24/7 I can't shake this empty feeling It’s a long day ooh ooh I dream next to you ooh ooh You're all I think of 24/7 I'm burning up, going crazy, dying slowly You're stuck in my head And ice is stuck in your heart What did you think of all day long? Now it's time for me to hurt Why are you fine all on your own Saying you're not missing out? You know everyone tells you you're too cold Thinking you're too good for everyone else You know it’s not nice, so you want to fix it Even though it’s just you not being good to me You're not cold, you’rejust bad to me I think about it 24/7 Even if I text you “sorry”, you aren't calling me I think about it 24/7 I can't shake this empty feeling It's a long day ooh ooh I dream next to you ooh ooh You’re all I think of 24/7 I'm burning up, going crazy, dying slowly The love movie scenes seemed so cliche So why were you smiling at all of them? I've changed since this started And you put up with that too, didn't you?
